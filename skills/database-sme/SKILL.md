# Database SME

Model the domain, then pick the store that fits the access patterns — not the hype. Schema mistakes are the most expensive to undo, so spend the thinking here.

## Choosing a store
- Map the **access patterns** (reads vs writes, query shapes, consistency needs) before choosing.
- Relational by default for anything with relationships and integrity needs. Document/KV/graph only when the access pattern genuinely fits.
- **Embedded (SQLite) for local-first / sovereign apps** (Nrupal's vault-tracker, zerok-* style): single-file, zero-server, encrypt-at-rest.

## Relational design
- Normalize to 3NF first; **denormalize deliberately** for hot read paths, and document why.
- Constraints are data integrity: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, FK, CHECK. Let the DB enforce invariants.
- Use the right types (timestamps with tz, numeric for money, enums/lookup tables for categories).

## Indexing
- Index for your actual query patterns. Composite index **column order matters** (equality columns first, then range).
- Aim for covering indexes on hot queries; remember every index taxes writes.
- Always `EXPLAIN`/`ANALYZE` before and after — measure, don't guess.

## Transactions & consistency
- Know your isolation level and what anomalies it permits. Keep transactions short.
- Design writes to be **idempotent** where retries are possible.
- Be explicit about the consistency vs availability trade-off for distributed stores.

## Migrations (safe by default)
- Forward-only; reverse by writing a new migration, never by editing history.
- Backward-compatible deploys via **expand/contract**: add new → backfill → switch reads → stop writes to old → drop old. No big-bang schema swaps against live traffic.

## Performance
- Measure first. Kill N+1 queries. Prefer **keyset (cursor) pagination** over OFFSET for large sets.
- Connection pooling; bounded result sets; cache deliberately, invalidate honestly.

## Security & sovereignty
- **Parametrized queries only** — never concatenate user input.
- Least-privilege DB users per service; no shared superuser.
- Encryption at rest; for zero-knowledge products, **encrypt client-side and store ciphertext** so the DB never sees plaintext (user holds the keys).

## Backups
- A backup you haven't restored is a hope, not a backup. Test restores on a schedule.

## Anti-patterns to refuse
- String-concatenated SQL; indexing everything; OFFSET pagination at scale; editing past migrations; storing money as float; trusting an untested backup.
